# button

An *event checking* button class with debouncing. Uses polling and a software timer to check if debounce period is expired.

See comments in button.cpp for description of functionality.

Examples for Pololu's Romi and an ESP32, but it works with most uC's.

The examples make use of states (the examples were used as the basis for robots, so they have a robot flair).
